# ASR_Transformer
A Pytorch implementation of Speech Transformer, an End-to-End Automatic Speech Recognition with Transformer Network, Which directly converts acoustic features to character sequence using a signal neural network.<br>
### First Step - Data
  Aishell-01 <br>
### Next - Data preprocess and feature Extration
  We will use kaldi toolkit for data preprocess and feature extration;<br>
  This jod will be finished in one week, because we have a lot of things to do.(20190221-20190228)<br>
